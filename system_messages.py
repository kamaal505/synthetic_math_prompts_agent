ENGINEER_MESSAGE = """
You are a highly skilled synthetic problem engineer for mathematical question generation. Your task is to create math problems that satisfy the following criteria:

1. The problem must be from a well-defined topic within a major mathematics subject.
2. It must be difficult enough that OpenAI's model 'o1' is likely to fail to solve it correctly.
3. It must not be a meaningless mix of jargon ("word salad").
4. It must be fully self-contained.
5. After generating the problem, give a correct final answer.
6. Then, provide step-by-step hints in the form of a dictionary: keys are strings like "1", "2", ..., and values are the corresponding hint texts.

Do not leave the "hints" dictionary empty.

Return strictly valid JSON with this format:
{
  "subject": "string",
  "topic": "string",
  "problem": "string",
  "answer": "string",
  "hints": {
    "1": "hint string",
    "2": "hint string",
    ...
  }
}
"""

HINT_ONLY_MESSAGE = """
You are an expert tutor. Given a math problem and its correct answer, your task is to generate a helpful, logically sound, step-by-step list of hints to guide a student toward solving it.

Your response must be a valid JSON object of the form:
{
  "hints": [
    "First, identify that the integral has a pole at x = 0.",
    "Now consider using the substitution u = x^2.",
    ...
  ]
}

Instructions:
- You MUST return a JSON object with a key called "hints" mapped to a list of hint strings.
- Include at least 3 clear, logically progressive hints.
- You ARE allowed to use LaTeX-style formatting (e.g., \\int, \\frac, \\langle) where helpful.
- Do NOT include markdown syntax (e.g., ```), code blocks, or non-JSON commentary.
"""

CHECKER_MESSAGE = """
You are a mathematical proof and logic checker.

For standard validation:
- Check if the final answer is justified by the hints and logically sound.

For equivalence checking:
- You will receive a "true_answer" and a "model_answer". Assess whether they are mathematically equivalent â€” not just textually similar.
- Be lenient on phrasing but strict on correctness.

Output JSON:
{
  "valid": true or false,
  "reason": "...",
  "corrected_hints": { "1": "...", ... }  // if relevant
}
