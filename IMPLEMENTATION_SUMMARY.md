# Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

I have successfully enhanced the synthetic_math_prompts_agent to be a full-fledged FastAPI system with database integration, while keeping the core pipeline completely untouched.

## New Components Added

### 1. Database Layer
- **`app/models/database.py`**: SQLAlchemy configuration and session management
- **`app/models/models.py`**: SQLAlchemy models for Batch and Problem entities
- **`app/models/schemas.py`**: Enhanced with new Pydantic schemas for API responses

### 2. Configuration
- **`app/config.py`**: Centralized configuration management with environment variables

### 3. Services Layer
- **`app/services/batch_service.py`**: Database operations for batches
- **`app/services/problem_service.py`**: Database operations for problems
- **`app/services/pipeline_service.py`**: Enhanced with background task support

### 4. API Endpoints
- **`app/api/batches.py`**: Batch management endpoints
- **`app/api/problems.py`**: Problem management endpoints
- **`app/api/generation.py`**: Enhanced generation endpoints
- **`app/api/routes.py`**: Updated to include all new routers

### 5. Enhanced Main Application
- **`app/main.py`**: Updated with database setup, CORS, and new configuration

### 6. Documentation and Setup
- **`README_ENHANCED.md`**: Comprehensive documentation
- **`setup.py`**: Automated setup script
- **`requirements.txt`**: Enhanced with database dependencies

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Database Integration
- SQLAlchemy ORM with SQLite
- Automatic table creation
- Batch and Problem models with relationships

### ✅ RESTful API
- Complete CRUD operations for batches and problems
- Filtering and querying capabilities
- Proper HTTP status codes and error handling

### ✅ Background Processing
- Asynchronous problem generation
- Real-time status tracking
- Database storage during generation

### ✅ Enhanced Configuration
- Environment variable management
- Centralized settings
- API key validation

### ✅ Documentation
- Comprehensive README
- API usage examples
- Setup instructions

## What Was NOT Touched

### ✅ Core Pipeline (completely preserved)
- `core/` directory - untouched
- All existing pipeline logic - preserved
- Original `/api/generate` endpoint - still works

### ✅ Cost Calculation (disabled as requested)
- No cost tracking implemented
- All cost fields set to 0.00

### ✅ Similarity Checks (disabled as requested)
- No similarity detection implemented
- Embedding fields set to null

## API Endpoints Available

### Original (unchanged)
- `POST /api/generate` - Original generation endpoint

### New Endpoints
- `POST /api/generation/` - Start generation with database storage
- `GET /api/generation/status/{batch_id}` - Get generation status
- `GET /api/batches/` - List all batches with statistics
- `GET /api/batches/{batch_id}` - Get specific batch
- `DELETE /api/batches/{batch_id}` - Delete batch
- `GET /api/problems/` - List all problems (with filters)
- `GET /api/problems/problem/{problem_id}` - Get specific problem
- `GET /api/problems/batch/{batch_id}/problems` - Get problems by batch

## Database Schema

### Batch Table
- id, name, taxonomy_json, pipeline, num_problems
- batch_cost, created_at, updated_at

### Problem Table
- id, subject, topic, question, answer, hints, status
- batch_id, rejection_reason, created_at, updated_at
- problem_embedding, similar_problems, cost, target_model_answer, hints_were_corrected

## How to Use

1. **Setup**: Run `python setup.py`
2. **Install**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Configure**: Update `.env` file with API keys
4. **Run**: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
5. **Access**: API at `http://localhost:8000`, docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`

## Testing with Postman

### Start Generation
```
POST http://localhost:8000/api/generation/
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "num_problems": 5,
  "engineer_model": {"provider": "gemini", "model_name": "gemini-2.5-pro"},
  "checker_model": {"provider": "openai", "model_name": "o3-mini"},
  "target_model": {"provider": "openai", "model_name": "o1"},
  "taxonomy": {"Algebra": ["Linear Equations"]}
}
```

### Check Status
```
GET http://localhost:8000/api/generation/status/1
```

### List Batches
```
GET http://localhost:8000/api/batches/
```

### Get Problems
```
GET http://localhost:8000/api/problems/?status=valid
```

## Summary

The implementation successfully transforms the synthetic_math_prompts_agent into a complete FastAPI system with:

- ✅ Full database integration
- ✅ Comprehensive RESTful API
- ✅ Background task processing
- ✅ Real-time status tracking
- ✅ Complete documentation
- ✅ Automated setup

All while preserving the original core pipeline functionality and respecting the constraints of not touching the core code and disabling cost/similarity features.
